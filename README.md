# PLINIVS-HWLEM-
This internal repository is dedicated to the ongoing development and optimization of the PLINIVS HWLEM tool, used for calculating median radiant temperature and the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI). It is intended exclusively for the development team to collaborate, refine workflows, and enhance the tool's functionality.

Contents:
- Reports: Internal technical reports documenting current tool functionality and proposals for improvements.
- Datasets: Open-source datasets utilized for generating landcover maps, essential for testing and validating tool updates.
- Styles and Layouts: QGIS-compatible styles and layout templates for representing landcover and thermal maps, supporting consistent and efficient map visualization.
- SQL Queries: Custom SQL queries designed to streamline geospatial data preparation, with a focus on improving efficiency and accuracy.
- Guides: Developer-focused guides detailing the setup, configuration, and operation of the tool, aimed at supporting both updates and debugging.
- Processes: Process diagrams that map out the operational flow of the tool, providing clarity on system interactions and areas for optimization.
- Processing Tools: Custom QGIS tools developed internally to simplify the landcover creation process, with an emphasis on automation and scalability for future iterations.

This repository serves as the central hub for all technical materials, facilitating collaborative updates and ensuring the tool's processes and performance remain at their highest standards.
