6. building_shadow_v2: This visual tool refines the created shadow from the buildings polygon layer, intersects the building shadow with the tree shadow to create a "shadows" layer, 
  and then intersects the "shadows" with the land cover. The results are as follows:
    a. Building shadow: Only the building shadows.
    b. Shadows: All shadows, including both building and tree shadows.
    c. luhw_study_area: Land cover with shadows.

  Input requirements:
    a. Buildings: Buildings with the attribute height.
    b. Tree_shadow: Tree shadow, provided as a polygon file.
    c. Initial_building_shadow: Initial building shadow exported using the 2.5D style and imported into the project.
    d. luhw_study.area_ns: Refers to the initial parameterized land cover without shadows.
    e. Study.area: Represents the delimitation of the study area in a polygon vector layer.
